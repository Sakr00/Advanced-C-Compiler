# Advanced C Compiler

**Unlock the Power of Code Compilation with our Advanced C Compiler!**

This feature-rich C compiler goes beyond traditional tools, offering a cutting-edge lexer, a robust syntax analyzer, and an advanced semantic analyzer. With a foundation built on a comprehensive Context-Free Grammar (CFG), it provides an unparalleled compilation experience. Not only does it meticulously parse and analyze code, but it also visualizes the syntax tree, providing a profound understanding of your code structure.

## Key Features

- **Lexer:** Efficiently tokenizes input C code.
- **Syntax Analyzer:** Parses the token stream to create a detailed syntax tree.
- **Semantic Analyzer:** Implements advanced type checking and semantic analysis.
- **CFG (Context-Free Grammar):** Adheres to a comprehensive set of grammar rules.
- **Syntax Tree Visualization:** Provides a visual representation of the syntax tree.
- **Visualized Analyzers:** Displays the syntax analyzer and semantic analyzer outputs as tree structures.

## Effort and Dedication

This project is a testament to our commitment to delivering a high-quality C compiler. The lexer ensures precise tokenization, the syntax analyzer constructs a detailed tree structure, and the semantic analyzer performs intricate type checking. The visualization of these processes enhances the overall understanding of code compilation.
